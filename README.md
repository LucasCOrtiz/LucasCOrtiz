  Hi, I'm Lucas! I am artificial intelligence and machine learning architect currently working at Slalom build. I have a long history of working in scientific research starting
  with my work at the Scripps Research Institute in high school. That fellowship sparked a lifelong passion for scientific research which has taken me through diverse fields
  including proteomics, computational biology, geostatistics, heat transfer in hypersaline brines, spatio-temporal statistics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. I've   also had the honor of teaching college courses ranging from math for the liberal arts to probability and statistics for engineers. Through of all of my pursuits I bring a        passion for excellence, inquisitiveness, and a desire to help others wherever I can through mentoring and leadership. Outside of work and academics you can find me skiing,       hiking, or basking in the desert sun of Moab, Utah. Some other interests of mine are quantiatitve finance, science fiction, speech and debate, and philosophy. 

  As an architect in AI/ML I empower clients to deliver insights from data using a strong core skill set of model development, feature engineering, data assimilation,              visualization, technical leadership, algorithm design, and cloud engineering. I have a robust background in applied mathematics, a PhD candidacy focused on spatio-               temporal modeling, and experience leading ML projects. Some specific projects I have worked on include developing GPT-based chatbots and RAG-based LLM applications,and           leveraging python to solve a wide variety of industrial use cases. I have working proficiency with  cloud-based architectures on AWS and Azure, infrastructure as code tools      such as terraform, and dev ops tools including azure dev ops, docker, jenkins, and kubernetes. I have experience deploying computer vision models with OpenCV on edge devices     and iOS, and applying advanced statistical methods for industrial problem-solving. As an internal education champion, I've had extensive experiencing mentoring junior data       scientists on both delivery teams and in workshops and other programs.
  
  My immediate learning goals (following the SMART framework) as as follows: 
  1. Reduce the manual effort of my workflows. While I have had great success in using manual skills for tasks such as data preparation (for example by assimilating different         sources into a single time series dataset using timeline matching, or labeling segmentation data). I have reached a point where I feel my skills aren't scaling as well to  
     larger problems and teams.
  3. Improve my practices around software engineering (specifically in the areas of testing and CI/CD) as it relates to the ML lifecycle. 


  My longer term goals are as follows: 
  1. Improve my infrastructure practices and knowledge to better deliver solutions in production at scale. 
  2. Increase my acumen in data engineering, particulary on the side of designing databases at scale. 
  3. Determine my long term path regarding individual contribution vs leadership.
