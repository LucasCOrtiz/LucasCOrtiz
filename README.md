  Hi, I'm Lucas! I am artificial intelligence and machine learning architect currently working at Slalom build. I have a long history of working in scientific research starting
  with my work at the Scripps Research Institute in high school. That fellowship sparked a lifelong passion for scientific research which has taken me through diverse fields
  including proteomics, computational biology, geostatistics, heat transfer in hypersaline brines, spatio-temporal statistics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. I've   also had the honor of teaching college courses ranging from math for the liberal arts to probability and statistics for engineers. Through of all of my pursuits I bring a        passion for excellence, inquisitiveness, and a desire to help others wherever I can through mentoring and leadership. Outside of work and academics you can find me skiing,       hiking, or basking in the desert sun of Moab, Utah. Some other interests of mine are quantiatitve finance, science fiction, speech and debate, and philosophy. 

  As an architect in AI/ML I help deliver insights from data using a strong core skill set of model development, feature engineering, data assimilation, visualization, technical   leadership, algorithm design, and cloud engineering. I have a robust background in applied mathematics and a PhD candidacy focused on spatio-temporal modeling. His core          skillset includes leading ML projects, such as developing GPT-based chatbots and RAG-based LLM applications, using technologies like Python (Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and R   (GGplot2, Tidyverse). He excels in cloud-based solutions on AWS and Azure, deploying computer vision models with OpenCV, and applying         advanced statistical methods for    industrial problem-solving. His experience spans machine learning, data science, cloud architecture, and mentoring junior data scientists.
